        Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The_Godfather parallels the
        young Vito Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The_Godfather's depiction of the
        dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after
        the local Mafia kills his family. Vito struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and
        growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci after he demands his customary cut of the
        tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows.
